# Docker Deployment on Render

This is a simple project about Post CRUD which is deployed on render by using docker. Throughout this project, 
I've explored and implemented various Docker-related practices, including creating 
Dockerfiles, building Docker images, and pushing them to Docker Hub.



- **Docker Hub Image**: https://hub.docker.com/r/diptosarkar182/docker_demo_post
- **Render Live Link**: https://docker-demo-post.onrender.com Please note that the app is hosted on a free tier 
and may take a moment to load if it has been inactive.
